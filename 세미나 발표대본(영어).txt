1 i will present about sift (Scale Invariant Feature Transform)
because i write a paper about image registration in this iccas conference
and because to gain background about our hanhwa assignment
so i analyze about sift

3  first , to make scale space
이게 인풋 이미지다 먼저 두배를 곱한뒤 repeat blurring while increasing the sigma value
그리고 인풋에도 블러링을 해주고 반으로 축소시킨뒤 블러링을 한다 또 반복한다
thanks to this work , sift has a property that is invariant to image'size

4 to get blurred image , convolution between gaussian filter and image

5 this is dog(difference of Gaussian)
First subtract the two adjacent blur images and we can get dog images   and we do this in all octave
so we get 4 dog images per one octave / so we can get total 16 dog images / so we can get image's edge information well   
 and  this is normalized image

6 originally we use log (laplacian of gaussian) to find keypoints like edge and corners
but we can replace log with dog
because in this graph red line is sigma c1 gaussian graph  green is sigma c2 gaussian graph
blue graph is green subtract red    so this blue graph is dog 
log graph and dog graph is almost same so we can use dog instead of log

7 to find keypoints from dog images
To find the maximum and minimum values, we need three dog images in the same octave
for example this is reference image that I want to find
neighbor pixel is  up image's 9pixels and 8pixels and down image's 9pixels
if this pixel is the smallest or biggest among neighbor pixels, this is keypoint
then, we cannot find keypoints in first image and last image
you can't see keypoints well   if you zoom in you can see

8 summary 
from this 5 images, 


13
I used sift code and bf matcher I can get this results  this is eo image this is ir image
Eo image has a higher registration performance than ir image
